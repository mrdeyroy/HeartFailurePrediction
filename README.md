# HeartFailurePrediction
A machine learning project that predicts the risk of heart failure based on clinical records. Trained using Random Forest and deployed with a Flask web application for real-time predictions. Built as part of a predictive modeling bootcamp.

## 🧠 Model

--> Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

--> Accuracy: ~85% on test data

--> Target: DEATH_EVENT (1 = death occurred, 0 = no death)
## 🚀 Features

~ Trained ML model using clinical data

~ Flask app with form inputs for 13 health indicators

~ Clean UI with inline CSS

~ Real-time prediction and display of result
## 📊 Dataset

Source: Provided by Bootcamp

Filename: heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv

Contains clinical features like age, platelets, serum sodium, creatinine, diabetes, etc.
